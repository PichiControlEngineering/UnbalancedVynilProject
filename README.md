# UnbalancedVynilProject
A simulation of an unbalanced upright vinyl player, and corresponding controller using python.
The [vinylDynamics.py](models/VinylDynamics.py) folder holds most important information in the _UnbalancedVinyl()_ class, holding both the system model and the solver method, such that all requirements are packed into one class. The Example.ipynb creates an easy interface to interact with the system and apply and plot different controllers.

# To be added
- More accurate parameter estimates regarding the imbalance in the [Example.ipynb](Example.ipynb) file
- Some form of animation, in order to visually represent the progression

# Where to start
Run the cells in [Example.ipynb](Example.ipynb) to see the system in action, and feel free to play around with parameters yourself
